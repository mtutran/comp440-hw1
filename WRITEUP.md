Every placeholder below gets your answer, told to Claude or typed in here yourself. Every number
you give comes from a script in this repo; say which one. Claude may format tables and figures
here; the words are yours.

## Part 0. Predictions

Give these to Claude before any analysis runs. One sentence each, plus one sentence on why you
think so.

**(1) A movie you know well, and what its three most-used tags will be:** Coco (2017) - I think music, family, emotional

**(1) Why you think so:** Music and family because the main story is Miguel's conflict between music and family. Emotional because of the idea that the dead fade away when nobody remembers.

**(2) Out of every 100 people who rated movies here, how many ever added a tag?** 10 out of 100

**(2) Why you think so:** Because tagging requires more effort than rating (choosing words instead of just choose a number on a scale 1-5)

**(3) Can one person's tags take over a movie's tag list? Yes or no:** yes

**(3) Why you think so:** Because there are movies rated by very few people and one person can add many tags to a movie, so a person's tags can make up most of what appears.

## Part 1. Whose data is this?

Code: `part1_data.py`.

**My rule for cutting 32 million ratings to 5 million** (written before reading `data/make_compact.py`)**:** Drawing ratings at random. It preserves the characteristics of the full data, thus, we could make statistics inference about the full data population using the subset.

**One rule I considered and rejected, and why:** I also considered keeping users with the highest number of ratings. However, I rejected it because it would introduce selection bias and the resulting sample would contain only active users who are likely very different from low activity users.

**One interesting thing from `data/README.md`:** I found the number of tagging users interesting, most tagging users remain in the subset.

**How the script's rule differs from mine, and what each keeps that the other drops:** The script's rule is not random, it first filters based on the number of ratings per movies, then filter users based on how many they have among those movies, then randomly samples only among the remaining eligible non-tagging users. My rule will keep movies with lower rating counts, low activity users and the overall characteristics of the data, while the script's rule focused on active users' ratings on popular movies.

**First check. Which of Claude's numbers, the different route you took, and whether it matched** (one good target: 6 tags are the literal text `NA`, which pandas drops unless told not to)**:** I checked distinct users who applied a tag using shell tools. The numbers matched, however, they calculate different things (users who rated something and also tagged vs every distinct userId in the tags file, whether or not they rated).

**Second check. Which of Claude's numbers, the different route you took, and whether it matched:** I checked tag rows whose text is literally NA using shell tools and it matched.

## Part 2. What tags best describe a movie?

Code: `part2_tags.py`.

**My movie, and why I picked it:** I picked Coco because I like musical and family-related movies. I also feel like the movie is very heartwarming.

**Its most misleading tag in the count-ordered list, and why it misleads:** I think none of the tags is really misleading, but the most misleading one is probably death since the story's overall theme is not about being died, it is a warm and colorful continuation of life.

**What I learned about how MovieLens collects ratings and tags, from rating and tagging my movie myself (about 100 words):** XXXX

### Up close

One sentence on the figure written before you saw it and one after. The two tables are where the
details below come from. Say which script made them.

**The figure, when the tags and the ratings arrived. What I expected:** I expect both to rise at the start, then fall.
**The figure, what it shows:** The overall trends of both lines match my expectation, they both rise at first, then fall. The ratings line stays above the tag applications line most of the time. The tag line has a sudden spike at the beginning of 2021.

**Two interesting details I learned up close that the counts did not show:** 1. One person has multiple distinct tags for the movie (user 78213 made 234 tags on Coco, most of them are very detail, not many of them get in top 10). 2. There is not much variation in ratings among people with different tags.

**Anything up close that contradicted something I had already written down. Which one, what the data showed, and what you now think. Or "nothing yet":** My prediction about Coco's tags in part 0 has 2 tags in top 10 and 1 did not get in top 10. My prediction about whether one person's tags can take over a movie's tag list in part 0 also does not match the results shown as the person with multiple tags does not have a lot of tags in the top 10. Now I think the answer to Can one person's tags take over a movie's tag list? in part 0 would be no.

### My definition

**My `score(movie, tag)`** (one or two sentences, precise enough that a classmate could code it)**:** A tag should score higher than another on the same movie if many users use that tag for the movie. The score should count each user once.

**One definition I considered and rejected, and why:** One definition I considered is weighted by the user's rating of the movie since if they like the movie, they probably have tags that describe the movie better (less misleading tags). However, I rejected this since it will bias the results, people who like the movie may describe the movie very different from general audience or people who do not like the movie.

**Which tags I merged as the same tag, which I kept apart, and why:** I merged strings that differ only in case or in leading and trailing whitespace since they are the same concept, just different format. I kept everything else apart since they may reflect a slight difference in the user's intention. For example, music could describe an element of the movie, while musical refers to its genre. Similarly, someone might tag "day of the dead" as they do not know or do not associate the movie with mexican culture.

**Why my definition, in about 150 words. Name one thing it gains and one thing it loses:**

I chose to score a tag by the number of distinct users applied it since this avoids allowing one user to inflate a tag's score by applying it multiple times. However, it can not assess the quality of the tag, as most people might just apply tags that are already there instead of coming up with their own words.

### The judge

The two slots below are read by scripts, so write them as bare lines: one item to a line, the
movieId first, no bullets and no numbering. A movie line looks like `296, Pulp Fiction (1994)`.
An order line looks like `296: nonlinear, hit men, dark comedy, ...`, the tags best first.

**My ten movies:**

XXXX

**My own order of the ten most-used tags, written before looking at any data: my movie from step 1, then my nine others from step 4:**

177765: family, heartwarming, music, afterlife, colorful, Pixar, animation, Dia de los Muertos, mexico, death

**One criterion I considered for the judge and rejected, and why** (the one I used is in `judge/criterion.md`)**:** XXXX

**Agreement. The number `agreement.py` gives for your `score()`, for popularity and for your own order, and which of the three came closest to the judge:** XXXX

**How the judge skill is built: the files it is made of and what each one does (about 150 words):**

XXXX

**What happens when I run `/judge`, from the first check to the CSV (about 150 words):**

XXXX

**Why a skill: what a skill like this gives you that a script or a prompt alone does not, and where you would use one next (about 100 words):**

XXXX

### The viewer and the disagreements

**One thing `movie_results.html` showed me that was useful, and one thing about it that got in my way:** XXXX

Then three improvements. For each: what the page would not let you see, what you had Claude
change, and what the changed page shows that the first draft did not.

**Improvement 1:** XXXX

**Improvement 2:** XXXX

**Improvement 3:** XXXX

Then the three disagreements. A disagreement is a movie and a tag where your `score()` and the
judge are furthest apart. For each: the movie and the tag, where your `score()` put it and where
the judge put it, and what you think accounts for the gap.

**Disagreement 1:** XXXX

**Disagreement 2:** XXXX

**Disagreement 3:** XXXX

**One other high-level pattern in the results, and what you think is behind it:** XXXX

## Predictions revisited

**Which of my three predictions were wrong, and what I make of each miss:** XXXX

## Part 3. What tags best describe a user?

Code: `part3_users.py`.

The slot below is read by a script, so write it as bare lines: one rating to a line, no bullets
and no numbering, the movieId first and the rating last, as in `296, Pulp Fiction (1994), 4.5`.

**My 20 ratings:**

XXXX

**My `score(user, tag)`, in a sentence, and why I started there (about 100 words):**

XXXX

**What my score says about me: my top ten tags, and whether they describe my taste (about 100 words):**

XXXX

**What my user viewer shows and why I chose that (about 100 words):**

XXXX

**What I put in the description column for a person, and why (about 150 words):**

XXXX

**My criterion for people: what it asks the judge to do that the movie criterion did not (about 60 words):**

XXXX

**The user-tag pairs I chose to judge, how many, and why those (about 100 words):**

XXXX

**Improvement 1: what I changed in the scoring function, what the judge and the viewer showed before and after (about 150 words):**

XXXX

**Improvement 2: the same (about 150 words):**

XXXX

## Part 4. Working with Claude

Give these to Claude the way you gave it the rest. Graded on the catch and the candor, not on
making Claude look good or bad.

**A moment where Claude was wrong or overconfident, how you caught it, and where it
happened. Name the part and the step, so the moment can be found:** XXXX

**One call where you overrode Claude, and why:** XXXX

**What you would hand to Claude sooner next time:** XXXX

**Did Claude name the misleading tag in Part 2 step 1 before you did? What happened:** XXXX

**The figure. Would asking Claude "what does this show?" have produced your sentence, and what
would have been missing from it:** XXXX

**Hours spent:** XXXX

**Anyone who helped you, or "no one":** XXXX
